## What is ConfigCat? 
[ConfigCat is a hosted feature flag and configuration management service](https://configcat.com/) that lets you separate releases from deployments. You can turn your features ON/OFF using ConfigCat Dashboard even after they are deployed. ConfigCat lets you target specific groups of users based on region, email or any other custom user attribute. Manage feature toggles across frontend, backend, mobile, desktop apps.

## üî• How does ConfigCat work?
- You set your feature flags on the ConfigCat Dashboard.
- Your feature flags get distributed across the ConfigCat CDN.
- The ConfigCat SDK in your application downloads and evaluates the feature flags.
